# PrimeCrawler
*A Python script which searches for prime numbers eternally, from a set starting number.*

## Requirements
This project requires you to have Python 3+ installed, however all dependencies are included in the vanilla version of Python.
The Python file included depends on the "io" library.

You must also have read/write permissions for the directory your file is hosted in.

## Setup
To set up the project, open the Python file with the IDE, and set the starting number you wish to begin from ("x"). To start from a number
higher than 3, you must have previously logged all prime numbers up to that point into the "primes.txt" file, and then have the starting
number above the final prime in the file.

If you wish to copy in the prime numbers, the file is formatted like so:
[PRIME NUMBER]
[PRIME NUMBER]
There is always a carriage return inbetween each number.

If you wish to start from 0, simply delete the "primes.txt" file, and set "x" to zero.
